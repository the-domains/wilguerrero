description: "As you've most likely heard the news, the world has lost one of the most influential musicians of this generation, David Bowie, at the age of 69. His transcendence and originality is something all artists can admire. Chris Duffy, the son of photographer Brian Duffy, takes you behind the scenes of the creative direction for some of Bowie and his father's collaborations."
